# FingerPrint Sample

[![CreateAppFaster]()](http://www.createappfaster.com/)

This is the FingerPrint Sample for the android. There are many sample available online.
This sample particulary focus on how to encrypt/decrypt data while using fingerprint for the login functionality.
Few notes here :-
  - Currently storing password in the sharedPref, but this is only for the demo purpose. Never do that in live prod applications.
  - Using dialog to get the fingerPrint, this is similar to the one used in Google sample Demo.
  - setUserAuthenticationRequired while building the key is set to false, in this demo. Do read about it!!!!
 

# How to use

  - Just clone the code and it is ready to use.
### Todos
- Code can be better architect, at the time of developing this i didnt intend to focus more on that.
- May be i will correct it :)
